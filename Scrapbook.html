                <td>Within the first week of the course we took part in a friendly introduction task, we then progressed
                    with understanding the command line and speaking to our PC's through our Terminal. This topic was
                    continued in the second lesson and on the weekend I completed the Murder Mystery task, which
                    involved solving a mystery through command line commands. I was also introduced to Git hub and
                    sucessfully learned how to create repositories on there. </td>

            <tr>
                <td>2:</td>
                <td>In week two we went over the use and importance of Git Hub, this was extremely helpful and helped me
                    put my learning into practice. We also met an old cohort member who we could ask questions about
                    their experience and I used this opportunity to ask about advice he would give us. We then had a
                    mini lecture with Jenny about how to ask questions, this will help with communicating our queries /
                    confusion.</td>
